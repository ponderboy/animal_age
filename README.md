# animal_age

A new Flutter project to show some skills we learned during the course.

## Getting Started

It basically is a 2 screens app. On the Home screen you can input the name of an animal and on the second you get it's lifespan. The latter is getting fetched bei the Wolfram|Alpha Shortanswer API and the corresponding image is downloaded via the Unsplash API. It has a nice simple workaround for errors and uses Googlefonts for the theme and custom styling.
